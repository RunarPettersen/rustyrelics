      By accessing or using Rusty Relics Auction House, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully before participating in any auctions or using our services.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      Users must be 18 years of age or older to participate in auctions. By registering, you confirm that all information provided is accurate and that you meet this requirement.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Accounts</h2>
    <p>
      You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials. Rusty Relics is not liable for unauthorized access resulting from your failure to secure your login information.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Bidding</h2>
    <p>
      Bids placed on auctions are binding. Once a bid is placed, it cannot be retracted. The highest bidder at the time of auction close is considered the winner and is obligated to complete the transaction.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Listings</h2>
    <p>
      All items listed for auction must be described truthfully and accurately. Rusty Relics reserves the right to remove or suspend listings that violate our guidelines or are reported for misconduct.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Credits and Transactions</h2>
    <p>
      Credits are used as bidding currency. Users are responsible for ensuring they have sufficient credits to participate. Credits are non-refundable and may not be exchanged for real-world currency.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6. Code of Conduct</h2>
    <p>
      Users must treat others with respect and refrain from abusive, threatening, or fraudulent behaviour. Rusty Relics may suspend or delete accounts that violate this policy without warning.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      Rusty Relics provides its platform “as is” and does not guarantee uninterrupted service. We are not responsible for losses or damages arising from your use of the platform.
