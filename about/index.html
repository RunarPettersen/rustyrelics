            Rusty Relics is an online auction house dedicated to timeless treasures, vintage curiosities, and rare collectibles. Whether you're a seasoned collector or a curious browser, we offer a unique platform to discover and bid on objects that carry history and character.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            We believe in the charm of imperfection and the stories objects tell. Every item listed has passed through hands and time, gaining its own patina of experience. Our mission is to give those items new life through community bidding and responsible resale.
          </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">How It Works</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Signing up is free and takes only a moment. Each user receives credits to participate in auctions. You can browse current listings, filter by category, or search for specific items. When you place a bid, the amount is locked in. If you’re the highest bidder when the auction ends, you win the item.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          You can also list your own items for auction. Add a photo, a description, and let other users compete to win your relic. It’s simple, transparent, and fun.
        </p>
    
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">Community & Transparency</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Rusty Relics thrives on a strong sense of community. We encourage respectful bidding and honest listings. Every user has a profile where their listings, bids, and wins are recorded. This transparency helps build trust between buyers and sellers.
        </p>
    
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">Our Vision</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          In a world of fast fashion and mass production, we aim to slow things down. By extending the life of objects and celebrating their uniqueness, we hope to promote sustainability, creativity, and the joy of discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for being part of our growing community. We hope you find something truly special here.
